# Project

This is my Portfolio Project to tell a little bit about me and my experiences.

This project was created with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) 
and the [classNames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) and [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) packages, the idea was to build my own components as I needed
